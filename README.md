These are two clustering scripts written from scratch in NumPy as an exercise in
understanding. The k-means script uses a k-mean++ algorithm to promote initial
clusters far away from each other. Both algorithms use the same dataset.
The Mini-Batch K-Means algorithm reads in all the data at the start for convenience 
but could easily be adapted to really take in batches from a larger dataset.
